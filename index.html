      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>John L Spetz at your service.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from the great state of Ohio.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Among my interests are computers.  I prefer the command line
      environment hence my preference for the ubiquitous text editor, Vim,
      which has a command line of its own..</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I suppose I will know my dream job should I find it.  Until then I like
      a programming environment.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Northeast Ohio in Lake county, due east of Cuyahoga county,
      location for Cleveland and Case Western Reserve University..</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>While I have independently studied HTML, I have never rounded out all
      the details.  I come from a programming coding environment using older
      procedural programming and find I need to update my skill set.   I look
      to gain a more complete understanding of web design, which I can pair
      with knowledge of newer iterations of programming languages like C++ and
      C#.</p>

      <h1><font color="FF0000">ADDENDUM:</font></h1>
      <p>There was an interesting wrinkle using GitHub Pages to publish this
      web page from within GitHub, which complicated the git push.  GitHub made
      me do an extra step of choosing a template, for which I chose minimal.  I
      did not stop to think GitHub would tweak the HTML to make this happen.
      GitHub created a new _config.yml file.
      </p>

      <p>
      <code>
      $ git push origin master<br>
      To https://github.com/johannsp/prework-about-me.git<br>
      &nbsp;! [rejected]        master -&gt; master (non-fast-forward)<br>
      error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/johannsp/prework-about-me.git'<br>
      hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind<br>
      hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.<br>
      hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.<br>
      hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
      </code>
      </p>

      <p>
      I read and followed some advice at:<br>
      <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2432579/git-your-branch-is-ahead-by-x-commits">
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2432579/git-your-branch-is-ahead-by-x-commits</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      This advice led me try a git fetch command
      </p>

      <p>
      <code>
      $ git fetch origin<br>
      remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.<br>
      remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.<br>
      remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.<br>
      remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 1 (delta 0), pack-reused 0<br>
      Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 292 bytes | 3.00 KiB/s, done.<br>
      From https://github.com/johannsp/prework-about-me<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d73e853..c0eec5b  master     -&gt; origin/master
      </code>
      </p>

      <p>
      This command did not help, as the same error happened trying the git push
      command.  What did work correctly was to do a proper pull command, which
      brought over _config.yml.
      </p>

      <p>
      <code>
      $ git pull origin master<br>
      From https://github.com/johannsp/prework-about-me<br>
       * branch            master     -&gt; FETCH_HEAD<br>
      Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.<br>
      &nbsp;_config.yml | 1 +<br>
      &nbsp;1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)<br>
      &nbsp;create mode 100644 _config.yml
      </code>
      </p>

      <p>
      The git push command worked after that, although I decided to write this
      addendum, which required a further update to GitHub.  As a further note
      to self I used code tags instead of pre tags for the monospaced samples,
      which necessitated adding &lt;br&gt;, escaping greater than sign in the
      "arrow" output, and some non-breaking space entitities (&amp;nbsp;) to
      protect real indentation.  I can use this addendum as a check of what I
      already knew about HTML as I started this course.
